# Requirements Meeting Agenda / Notes ( 2021-03-30 )

The current algorithms are very parameterized ( on purpose ) for two reasons:
- to allow experimental instrumentation in order to understand the device and typical measurements ( and measurement ranges ) in order to develop operational algorithms
- to allow operational instrumentation in order to better calibrate the device and/or results presentation to the user
