# Requirements Meeting Agenda / Notes ( 2021-03-30 )
## Data Needed
The current algorithms are very parameterized ( on purpose ) for two reasons:
- to allow experimental instrumentation in order to understand the device and typical measurements ( and measurement ranges ) in order to develop operational algorithms
- to allow operational instrumentation in order to better calibrate the device and/or results presentation to the user

The following subsections describe the data needed to further develop algorithms.
### MAX Perturbation of Resting Device Position
How far off [nadir](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nadir), in either a positive or negative rotation, shall the device algorithms / configuration treat as an absolute max? This will probably need to be determined empirically through a PoC with the device placed in multiple *non-nadir* orientations.

### MAX User Posture Tilt
What is the max reasonable posture tilt measurement / calculation for a user? This will be used to define the upper bounds for a number of algorithm decision points.

With the _max perturbation_ and _max user posture tilt_, a 5 state model can be defined for measurements, that is:

```
   | - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - | * * * * | - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - |
         < -RED >           < -YELLOW >      <GREEN>       < +YELLOW >          < +RED >

   R_Y_STATE_RANGE = (MAX User Posture Tilt - (MAX Perturbation of Resting Device Position)/2)/2
   -RED    == [-MAX User Posture Tilt, -MAX User Posture Tilt + R_Y_STATE_RANGE)
   -YELLOW == [-MAX User Posture Tilt + R_Y_STATE_RANGE, - (MAX Perturbation of Resting Device Position)/2)
   GREEN   == [-(MAX Perturbation of Resting Device Position)/2,(MAX Perturbation of Resting Device Position)/2]
   YELLOW  == ((MAX Perturbation of Resting Device Position)/2, MAX User Posture Tilt - R_Y_STATE_RANGE]
   RED     == (MAX User Posture Tilt - R_Y_STATE_RANGE,MAX User Posture Tilt]
```

### Vibration Threshold
What is the threshold posture tilt measurement for deciding when to make the device vibrate?
